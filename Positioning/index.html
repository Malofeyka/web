        <p>
            These license terms are an agreement between you and
            · the computer manufacturer that distributes the software with the computer, or
            · the software installer that distributes the software with the computer.
            Please read them. They apply to the software named above, which includes the media on which you
            received it, if any. Printed-paper license terms, which may come with the software take the place of any
            on-screen license terms. These terms also apply to any Microsoft
            · updates,
            · supplements,
            · Internet-based services, and
            · support services
            for this software, unless other terms accompany those items. If so, those other terms apply.
            If you obtain updates or supplements directly from Microsoft, Microsoft, and not the manufacturer or
            installer, licenses those to you.
            By using the software, you accept these terms. If you do not accept them, do not use the
            software. Instead, contact the manufacturer or installer to determine its return policy. You must
            comply with that policy, which might limit your rights or require you to return the entire system
            on which the software is installed.
            As described below, using the software also operates as your consent to the transmission of
            certain computer information during activation, validation and for Internet -based services.
            If you comply with these license terms, you have the rights below for each license you acquire.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>1. OVERVIEW.</strong>
            a. Software. The software includes desktop operating system software. This software does not include
            Windows Live services. Windows Live services are available from Microsoft under a separate
            agreement.
            b. License Model. The software is licensed on a per copy per computer basis. A computer is a physical
            hardware system with an internal storage device capable of running the software. A hardware partition
            or blade is considered to be a separate computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>2. INSTALLATION AND USE RIGHTS.</strong>
            a. One Copy per Computer. The software license is permanently assigned to the computer with which
            the software is distributed. That computer is the “licensed computer.”
            b. Licensed Computer. You may use the software on up to two processors on the licensed computer
            at one time. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, you may not use the software on any
            other computer.
            c. Number of Users. Unless otherwise provided in these license terms, only one user may use the
            software at a time on the licensed computer.
            d. Alternative Versions. The software may include more than one version, such as 32-bit and 64-bit.
            You may use only one version at one time. If the manufacturer or installer provides you with a one -
            time selection between language versions, you may use only the one language vers ion you select.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>3. ADDITIONAL LICENSING REQUIREMENTS AND/OR USE RIGHTS.</strong>
            a. Multiplexing. Hardware or software you use to
            · pool connections, or
            · reduce the number of devices or users that directly access or use the software
            (sometimes referred to as “multiplexing” or “pooling”), does not reduce the number of licenses you
            need.
            b. Font Components. While the software is running, you may use its fonts to display and print
            content. You may only
            · embed fonts in content as permitted by the embedding restrictions in the fonts; and
            · temporarily download them to a printer or other output device to print content.
            c. Icons, Images and Sounds. While the software is running, you may use but not share its icons,
            images, sounds, and media. The sample images, sounds and media provided with the software are for
            your non-commercial use only.
            d. Use with Virtualization Technologies. Instead of using the software directly on the licensed
            computer, you may install and use the software within only one virtual (or otherwise emulated)
            hardware system on the licensed computer. When used in a virtualized environment, content
            protected by digital rights management technology, BitLocker or any full volume disk drive encryption
            technology may not be as secure as protected content not in a virtualized environment. You should
            comply with all domestic and international laws that apply to such protected content.
            e. Device Connections. You may allow up to 20 other devices to access software installed on the
            licensed computer to use only File Services, Print Services, Internet Information Services and Internet
            Connection Sharing and Telephony Services.
            f. Remote Access Technologies You may access and use the software installed on the licensed
            computer remotely from another device using remote access technologies as follows.
            · Remote Desktop. The single primary user of the licensed computer may access a session from any
            other device using Remote Desktop or similar technologies. A “session” means the experience of
            interacting with the software, directly or indirectly, through any combination of input, output and
            display peripherals. Other users may access a session from any device using these technologies, if the
            remote device is separately licensed to run the software.
            · Other Access Technologies. You may use Remote Assistance or similar technologies to share an active
            session.
            g. Media Center Extender. You may have five Media Center Extender sessions (or other software or
            devices which provide similar functionality for a similar purpose) running at the same time to display
            the software user interface or content on other displays or devices.
            h. Electronic Programming Guide. If the software includes access to an electronic programming
            guide service that displays customized television listings, a separate service agreement applies to the
            service. If you do not agree to the terms of the service agreement, you may continue to use the
            software, but you will not be able to use the electronic programming guide service. The service may
            contain advertising content and related data, which are received and stored by the software. The
            service is not available in all areas. Please consult the software information for instructions on
            accessing the service agreement.
            i. Related Media Information. If you request related media information as part of your playback
            experience, the data provided to you may not be in your local language. Some countries or regions
            have laws and regulations which may restrict or limit your ability to access certain types of content.
            j. Worldwide Use of the Media Center. Media Center is not designed for use in every country. For
            example, although the Media Center information may refer to certain features such as an electronic
            programming guide or provide information on how to configure a TV tuner, these features may not
            work in your area. Please refer to the Media Center information for a list of features that may not work
            in your area.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>4. MANDATORY ACTIVATION.</strong>
            Activation associates the use of the software with a specific computer. During activation, the software
            will send information about the software and the computer to Microsoft. This information includes the
            version, language and product key of the software, the Internet protocol address of the computer, and
            information derived from the hardware configuration of the computer. For more information, see
            go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104609. By using the software, you consent to the transmission of
            this information. If properly licensed, you have the right to use the version of the software installed
            during the installation process up to the time permitted for activation. Unless the software is
            activated, you have no right to use the software after the time permitted for activation. This is to
            prevent its unlicensed use. You are not permitted to bypass or circumvent activation. If the
            computer is connected to the Internet, the software may automatically connec t to Microsoft for
            activation. You can also activate the software manually by Internet or telephone. If you do so, Internet
            and telephone service charges may apply. Some changes to your computer components or the
            software may require you to reactivate the software. The software will remind you to activate it
            until you do.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>5. VALIDATION.</strong>
            a. Validation verifies that the software has been activated and is properly licensed. It also verifies that
            no unauthorized changes have been made to the validation, licensing, or activation functions of the
            software. Validation may also check for certain malicious or unauthorized software related to such
            unauthorized changes. A validation check confirming that you are properly licensed permits you to
            continue to use the software, certain features of the software or to obtain additional benefits. You are
            not permitted to circumvent validation. This is to prevent unlicensed use of the software. For more
            information, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104610.
            b. The software will from time to time perform a validation check of the software. The check may be
            initiated by the software or Microsoft. To enable the activation function and validation checks, the
            software may from time to time require updates or additional downloads of the validation, licensing or
            activation functions of the software. The updates or downloads are required for the proper functioning
            of the software and may be downloaded and installed without further notice to you. During or after a
            validation check, the software may send information about the software, the computer and the results
            of the validation check to Microsoft. This information includes, for example, the version and product
            key of the software, any unauthorized changes made to the validation, licensing or activation functions
            of the software, any related malicious or unauthorized software found and the Internet protocol
            address of the computer. Microsoft does not use the information to identify or contact you. By using
            the software, you consent to the transmission of this information. For more information about
            validation and what is sent during or after a validation check, see
            go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104611.
            c. If, after a validation check, the software is found to be counterfeit, improperly licensed, or a nongenuine Windows product, or if it includes unauthorized changes, then the functionality and
            experience of using the software will be affected. For example:
            Microsoft may
            · repair the software, and remove, quarantine or disable any unauthorized changes that may interfere
            with the proper use of the software, including circumvention of the activation or validation functions of
            the software; or
            · check and remove malicious or unauthorized software known to be related to such unauthorized
            changes; or
            · provide notice that the software is improperly licensed or a non-genuine Windows product;
            and you may
            · receive reminders to obtain a properly licensed copy of the software; or
            · need to follow Microsoft’s instructions to be licensed to use the software and reactivate;
            and you may not be able to
            · use or continue to use the software or some of the features of the software; or
            · obtain certain updates or upgrades from Microsoft.
            d. You may only obtain updates or upgrades for the software from Microsoft or authorized sources.
            For more information on obtaining updates from authorized sources see
            go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?Linkid=104612.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>6. POTENTIALLY UNWANTED SOFTWARE.</strong> If turned on, Windows Defender will search your
            computer for “spyware,” “adware” and other potentially unwanted software. If it finds potentially
            unwanted software, the software will ask you if you want to ignore, disable (quarantine) or remove it.
            Any potentially unwanted software rated “high” or “severe,” will automatically be removed after
            scanning unless you change the default setting. Removing or disabling potentially unwanted software
            may result in
            · other software on your computer ceasing to work, or
            · your breaching a license to use other software on your computer.
            By using this software, it is possible that you will also remove or disable software that is not potentially
            unwanted software.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>7. INTERNET-BASED SERVICES.</strong> Microsoft provides Internet-based services with the software. It may
            change or cancel them at any time.
            a. Consent for Internet-Based Services. The software features described below and in the Windows 7
            Privacy Statement connect to Microsoft or service provider computer systems over the Internet. In
            some cases, you will not receive a separate notice when they connect. In some cases, you may switch
            off these features or not use them. For more information about these features, see the Windows 7
            Privacy Statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104604. By using these features, you consent
            to the transmission of the information described below. Microsoft does not use the information to
            identify or contact you.
            Computer Information. The following features use Internet protocols, which send to the appropriate
            systems computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system,
            browser and name and version of the software you are using, and the language code of the computer
            where you installed the software. Microsoft uses this information to make the Internet-based services
            available to you.
            · Plug and Play and Plug and Play Extensions. You may connect new hardware to your computer, either
            directly or over a network. Your computer may not have the drivers needed to communicate with that
            hardware. If so, the update feature of the software can obtain the correct driver from Microsoft and
            install it on your computer. An administrator can disable this update feature.
            · Windows Update. To enable the proper functioning of the Windows Update service in the software (if
            you use it), updates or downloads to the Windows Update service will be required from time to time
            and downloaded and installed without further notice to you.
            · Web Content Features. Features in the software can retrieve related content from Microsoft and
            provide it to you. Examples of these features are clip art, templates, online training, online assistance
            and Appshelp. You may choose not to use these web content features.
            · Digital Certificates. The software uses digital certificates. These digital certificates confirm the identity
            of Internet users sending X.509 standard encrypted information. They also can be used to digitally sign
            files and macros, to verify the integrity and origin of the file contents . The software retrieves
            certificates and updates certificate revocation lists over the Internet, when available.
            · Auto Root Update. The Auto Root Update feature updates the list of trusted certificate authorities.
            You can switch off the Auto Root Update feature.
            · Windows Media Digital Rights Management. Content owners use Windows Media digital rights
            management technology (WMDRM) to protect their intellectual property, including copyrights. This
            software and third party software use WMDRM to play and copy WMDRM-protected content. If the
            software fails to protect the content, content owners may ask Microsoft to revoke the software’s ability
            to use WMDRM to play or copy protected content. Revocation does not affect other content. When
            you download licenses for protected content, you agree that Microsoft may include a revocation list
            with the licenses. Content owners may require you to upgrade WMDRM to access their content.
            Microsoft software that includes WMDRM will ask for your consent prior to the upgrade. If you decline
            an upgrade, you will not be able to access content that requires the upgrade. You may switch off
            WMDRM features that access the Internet. When these features are off, you can still play content for
            which you have a valid license.
            · Windows Media Player. When you use Windows Media Player, it checks with Microsoft for
            · compatible online music services in your region; and
            · new versions of the player.
            For more information, go to go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=104605.
            · Malicious Software Removal. During setup, if you select “Get important updates for installation”, the
            software may check for and remove certain malware from your computer. “Malware” is malicious
            software. If the software runs, it will remove the Malware listed and updated at
            www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. During a Malware check, a report will be sent to Microsoft
            with specific information about Malware detected, errors, and other information about your computer.
            This information is used to improve the software and other Microsoft products and services. No
            information included in these reports will be used to identify or contact you. You may disable the
            software’s reporting functionality by following the instructions found at
            www.support.microsoft.com/?kbid=890830. For more information read the Windows Malicious
            Software Removal Tool privacy statement at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkId=113995.
            · Network Awareness. This feature determines whether a system is connected to a network by either
            passive monitoring of network traffic or active DNS or HTTP queries. The query only transfers standard
            TCP/IP or DNS information for routing purposes. You can switch off the active query feature through a
            registry setting.
            · Windows Time Service. This service synchronizes with time.windows.com once a week to provide your
            computer with the correct time. You can turn this feature off or choose your preferred time source
            within the Date and Time Control Panel applet. The connection uses the standard NTP protocol.
            · IPv6 Network Address Translation (NAT) Traversal service (Teredo). This feature helps existing home
            Internet gateway devices transition to IPv6. IPv6 is the next generation Internet protocol. It helps
            enable end-to-end connectivity often needed by peer-to-peer applications. To do so, each time you
            start up the software the Teredo client service will attempt to locate a public Teredo Internet service. It
            does so by sending a query over the Internet. This query only transfers standard Domain Name Service
            information to determine if your computer is connected to the Internet and can locate a public Teredo
            service. If you
            · use an application that needs IPv6 connectivity, or
            · configure your firewall to always enable IPv6 connectivity,
            Then, by default standard Internet Protocol information will be sent to the Teredo service at Microsoft
            at regular intervals. No other information is sent to Microsoft. You can change this default to use nonMicrosoft servers. You can also switch off this feature using a command line utility named “netsh”.
            · Accelerators. When you click on or move your mouse over an Accelerator, in Internet Explorer, any of
            the following may be sent to the service provider:
            · the title and full web address or URL of the current webpage,
            · standard computer information, and
            · any content you have selected.
            If you use an Accelerator provided by Microsoft, use of the information sent is subject to the Microsoft
            Online Privacy Statement. This statement is available at go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you
            use an Accelerator provided by a third party, use of the information sent will be subject to the third
            party’s privacy practices.
            · Search Suggestions Service. In Internet Explorer, when you type a search query in the Instant Search
            box or type a question mark (?) before your search term in the Address bar, you will see search
            suggestions as you type (if supported by your search provider). Everything you type in the Instant
            Search box or in the Address bar when preceded by a question mark (?) is sent to your search provider
            as you type. Also, when you press Enter or click the Search button, the text in the Instant Search box or
            Address bar is sent to the search provider. If you use a Microsoft search provider, use of the
            information sent is subject to the Microsoft Online Privacy Statement. This statement is available at
            go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=31493. If you use a third-party search provider, use of the information
            sent will be subject to the third party’s privacy practices. You can turn search suggestions off at any
            time. To do so, use Manage Add-ons under the Tools button in Internet Explorer. For more information
            about the search suggestions service, see go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=128106.
            · Consent to Update Infrared Emitter/Receiver. The software may contain technology to ensure the
            proper functioning of the infrared emitter/receiver device shipped with certain Media Center -based
            products. You agree that the software may update the firmware of this computer.
            · Media Center Online Promotions. If you use Media Center features of the software to access Internetbased content or other Internet-based services, such services may obtain the following information
            from the software to enable you to receive, accept and use certain promotional offers:
            · certain computer information, such as your Internet protocol address, the type of operating system
            and browser you are using, and the name and version of the software you are using,
            · the requested content, and
            · the language code of the computer where you installed the software.
            Your use of the Media Center features to connect to those services serves as your consent to the
            collection and use of such information.
            b. Use of Information. Microsoft may use the computer information, accelerator information, search
            suggestions information, error reports, and Malware reports to improve our software and services. We
            may also share it with others, such as hardware and software vendors. They may use the information to
            improve how their products run with Microsoft software.
            c. Misuse of Internet-based Services. You may not use these services in any way that could harm
            them or impair anyone else’s use of them. You may not use the services to try to gain unauthorized
            access to any service, data, account or network by any means.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>8. SCOPE OF LICENSE.</strong> The software is licensed, not sold. This agreement only gives you some rights
            to use the features included in the software edition you licensed. The manufacturer or installer and
            Microsoft reserve all other rights. Unless applicable law gives you more rights despite this limitation,
            you may use the software only as expressly permitted in this agreement. In doing so, you must comply
